# Project3-Hospital_Patient_Queue-
The **Hospital Patient Queue Management System** is a C++ application that manages emergency and regular patients using a priority queue for critical cases and a normal queue for regular patients. It allows users to add patients, process them based on severity, and display estimated wait times, enhancing efficiency in hospital patient management.
# Hospital Patient Queue Management System

This project implements a Hospital Patient Queue Management System in C++. The system manages both emergency (critical) and regular patients using a priority queue for critical cases and a normal queue for regular cases. It also displays the estimated wait time for patients.

## Features

- **Priority Queue**: Manages critical patients based on severity.
- **Normal Queue**: Handles regular patients.
- **Estimated Wait Time**: Displays the total estimated wait time based on the number of patients processed.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++11 or later

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-patient-queue.git
   cd hospital-patient-queue
